# Solarized dark variation for prolonged reading

This fork aims to give solarized dark a **clean** look and lesser **eye strain** with nimble but efficient modifications by selectively boldening font and removing irritating reddish colors.

### Features

* Matching HTML and CSS highlighting based on elements' level and specificity
* Go(lang) code highlighting matches that of Emacs's solarized theme
* Braces aren't colored for better readability
